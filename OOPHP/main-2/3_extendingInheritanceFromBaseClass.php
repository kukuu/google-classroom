//Define a base Employee class
class Employee {
	private $name;
	
	//Define a setter for the private $name member.
	function setName($name){
		if ($name == "") {
			echo "Name cannot be blank!";
		}
		else {
			$this -> name =  $name;
		}
	}
	//Define a getter for the the private $name member to return the value
	function getName() {
		return "My name is ".$this -> name." <br />";
	}
}//End of Employee class

//1 Now define an Executive class that inherits   from Employee

class Executive extends Employee {
	//Define a method unique to Employee
	function pillageCompany () {
		echo "I am selling  company assets to finance my yatch.";
	}

}//End Executive class

//Create a new executive object

$exec = new Executive();

//Call the setName() method defined in the Employee class
$exec -> setName("Alexander");

//Call the Employee getName() method
echo $exec -> getName();





//2. Extending Executive: class CEO extends Executive
class CEO extends Executive {
	function getFaceLift() {
		echo " I need some square jaws";
	}
}

$ceo = new CEO();
//Now call the pillageCompany methid for associiation
$ceo  -> pillageCompany();
$ceo  ->getFaceLift();
